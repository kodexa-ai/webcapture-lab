# Webcapture Lab

This repository contains a basic Python setup to allow you to test out your scripting for Selenium and Helium.

The scripts you work on here can then be used with a Kodexa Web Capture Assistant.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have a copy of Anaconda Desktop installed on your machine and then run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment
conda activate webcapture_lab
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Google Chrome installed.

Download Visual Studio Code and then open this folder.

Make sure you have the Python extension installed, and then ensure that at the bottom left you have selected the "webcapture_lab" conda environment.

### Writing your first script

We have included an example script in script-test.py, open this with Visual Studio Code.

Finally, right click and choose Run File in Interactive Window.  It should open your Google Chrome and goto the Sallie Mae website and interact.
